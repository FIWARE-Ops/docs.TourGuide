All the FIWARE Cloud capabilities outlined above can be invoked via
OpenStack APIs, with unique extensions currently available only in
FIWARE. A typical interaction would start by authenticating against the
Identity Management GE, and getting a token that can be used in
consequent calls to the individual services. For standard OpenStack
APIs, one can use an existing client library - one of the [many
maintained in the open source
community](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SDKs).
