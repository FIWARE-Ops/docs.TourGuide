The FIWARE Object Storage allows storing and retrieving ‘blob’ objects
via OpenStack Swift RESTful API (or via the FIWARE Cloud Portal).
Objects are organized in containers (aka folders), and can include
arbitrary key-value metadata. The FIWARE Object Storage provides high
resiliency by keeping 3 copies of each object. Moreover, the underlying
implementation (based on **OpenStack Swift**) can scale up to many PBs
of data (while the disk space available in the experimental FIWARE Lab
environment is typically more limited).

More details on accessing the FIWARE Object Storage can be found in the
