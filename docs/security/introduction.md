In FIWARE we offer some services and tools to allow you to manage
authentication and authorization in your applications and backend
services. If you want to manage identity in your application without
developing your own mechanisms, you can offer your users the possibility
to log in to your app using their FIWARE Accounts.  
    
 This is possible thanks to the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) protocol
and Keyrock, the Identity Manager component of FIWARE. In the same way
that you usually log in to some services using your Twitter or Facebook
account, your users will use their FIWARE accounts to access your
service. But this is only the first step, because you can also secure
your backends using FIWARE Account. If your service or GE has a REST API
that can be accessed from Internet, probably you want to manage the
access to the resources. For instance, you can allow the access only to
the users that have a FIWARE account.    
    
 Furthermore, if you want to differentiate user permissions based on
roles, thanks to the Access Control component of FIWARE, you can define
the various roles, possibly with role hierarchies, and define specific
permissions for each role. This way you can determine which type of
users can access which specific resource in your backends.  You can also
manage basic role permissions via the Identity Management user interface
and they will be pushed automatically to the Access Control component.
For more advanced role permissions, for instance combining user roles
with other user attributes, resource attributes (besides the URL), or
environment attributes (e.g. time constraints), you would use the Access
Control interface directly. In any case, you can assign roles to your
users with the Identity Management interface.  
    
 So the two components that you have to know in order to manage access
control in your services are:

**[Keyrock
GE](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/identity-management-keyrock)**

Identity Management covers a number of aspects involving users' access
to networks, services and applications, including secure and private
authentication from users to devices, networks and services,
authorization & trust management, user profile management,
privacy-preserving disposition of personal data, Single Sign-On (SSO) to
service domains and Identity Federation towards applications. The
Identity Manager is the central component that provides a bridge between
IdM systems at connectivity-level and application-level.  
    
 Thanks to this GE you can create users and organizations in FIWARE. You
can also register new applications in order to use the OAuth2 protocol
described above and to manage roles and permissions in them.

[**Access Control
GE**](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/access-control-tha-implementation)

The Access Control GE provides XACML-standard-compliant authorization
services. The OASIS XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language)
standard [1] is the only existing standard access control language
written in XML as of writing. According to the OASIS XACML FAQ, “it
provides an extremely flexible language for expressing access control
that can use virtually any sort of information as the basis for
decisions. It is a functional superset of other familiar access control
schemes, such as permissions, ACLs, RBAC, etc. It is particularly
designed to support large-scale environments where resources are
distributed and policy administration is Federated.”

In short, this component proves to be useful when dynamic
attribute-based access control matters, i.e. when authorization depends
on attributes in the context of the access request, such as the
requester (subject)'s attributes, the requested action, the requested
resource, and possibly environment attributes. The component may be used
in various ways to control access to critical resources such as other
FIWARE GEs or applications deployed by developers from use case
projects. It provides APIs to developers - or security policy authors in
general - for managing ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) and/or RBAC
(Role-Based Access Control) policies, and getting authorization
decisions for these policies. It may be combined with the FIWARE
Security Proxy playing the role of PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), in
which case the Access Control GE plays the role of PDP (Policy Decision
Point) in XACML terms.
