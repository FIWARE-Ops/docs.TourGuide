The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to
create a fully-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality. These widgets
can be visually connected in the wiring editor to the back-end services
or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including
filters, aggregators, adapters, etc.

The wiring editor comes with a recommendation system for connections
that help you to identify compatible endpoints that could be connected.
