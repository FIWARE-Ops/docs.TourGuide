In order to send commands to devices, developers just need to know which
attributes correspond to commands and update them.

IoT integrators need to declare the command related attributes at the
registry process (POST request) in the following way:

    POST <idas_host>:<idas_port>/iot/devices
    //Example: HTTP POST: http://130.206.80.40:5371/iot/devices 
    Headers: {'content-type': 'application/json’; 'X-Auth-Token' : [TOKEN]; "Fiware-Service: OpenIoT”; "Fiware-ServicePath: /"}
    Payload:
    {"devices": [
        { "device_id": ”[DEV_ID]",
        "entity_name": ”[ENTITY_ID]",
        "entity_type": "thing",
        "endpoint": "http://[DEVICE_IP]:[PORT]",
        "timezone": ”Europe/Madrid",
        "commands": [
            { "name": ”RawCommand",
            "type": "command",
            "value": “[Dev_ID]@RawCommand|%s"
            } ],
        "attributes": [

 

Any update on this attribute “RawCommand” at the NGSI entity in the
ContextBroker will send a command to your device.

If the row **"endpoint": "****http://[DEVICE\_IP]:[PORT]"** is declared,
then your device is supposed to be listening for commands at that URL in
a synchronous way.

If that enpoint is not declared (if that row does not exist) then yur
devices is supposed to work in a polling mode and therefore receiving
commands in an asynchronous way (i.e. when the device proactively asks
for commands).

For a device working in the polling mode to receive commands, the full
pending queue of commands will be received with the following HTTP GET
request:

 

    POST <idas_host>:<idas_port>/d?k=<apikey>&i=<device_ID>
    //Example: HTTP GET:
    Headers: {'content-type': 'application/text’; 'X-Auth-Token' : [TOKEN]; "Fiware-Service: OpenIoT”; "Fiware-ServicePath: /"}
    http://130.206.80.40:5371/iot/d?k=[APIKEY]&i=[DEV_ID]
