Kurento Media Server capabilities are exposed by the Kurento API to
application developers. This API is implemented by means of libraries
called Kurento Clients. Kurento offers two clients out of the box for
Java and JavaScript. If you have another favourite language, you can
still use Kurento using directly the Kurento Protocol. This protocol
allows to control Kurento Media Server and it is based on Internet
standards such as WebSocket and JSON-RPC. The picture below shows how to
use Kurento Clients in three scenarios:

-   Using the Kurento JavaScript Client directly in a compliant WebRTC
    browser
-   Using the Kurento Java Client in a Java EE Application Server
-   Using the Kurento JavaScript Client in a Node.js server

Kurento Client’s API is based on the concept of Media Element. A Media
Element holds a specific media capability. For example, the media
element called WebRtcEndpoint holds the capability of sending and
receiving WebRTC media streams, the media element called
RecorderEndpoint has the capability of recording into the file system
any media streams it receives, the FaceOverlayFilter detects faces on
the exchanged video streams and adds a specific overlaid image on top of
them, etc. Kurento exposes a rich toolbox of media elements as part of
its APIs.
