In the FIWARE IoT architecture, FogFlow is the cloud-edge computing framework to enable dynamic data processing for IoT Data Analytics Services in between context producers (e.g., small IoT devices like temperature/humidity sensors or connected cameras) and situation consumers (e.g., alarms or external apps that subscribe to the results generated by FogFlow). The external application can be also Orion Context Broker.

As illustrated by the figure above, FogFlow can allow IoT service developers to quickly define and launch a data processing function over the cloud and edges in a transparent and efficient manner.
