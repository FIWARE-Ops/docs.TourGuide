In the FIWARE IoT architecture, FogFlow is the cloud-edge computing framework to enable dynamic data processing for IoT Data Analytics Services in between context producers (e.g., small IoT devices like temperature/humidity sensors or connected cameras) and situation consumers (e.g., alarms or external apps that subscribe to the results generated by FogFlow). The external application can be also Orion Context Broker.

As illustrated by the figure above, FogFlow can allow IoT service developers to quickly define and launch a data processing function over the cloud and edges in a transparent and efficient manner. The main features of FogFlow can be guided by the following three steps. 

1) Service developers define and submit fog functions with the provided function template


2) Context producers start to producer the raw contextual data, which will trigger the relevant fog functions to be deployed on the fly for generating high level contextual situations. 


3) Situations are consumed by consumers
