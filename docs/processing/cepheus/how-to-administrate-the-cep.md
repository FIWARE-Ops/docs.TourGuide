There are REST services that allow you to manage the CEP definition
repository that holds the CEP application definitions available to the
CEP engine at run time. These services allow putting a new application
definition to the repository, getting a specific application definition
from the repository, updating a repository application definition or
deleting a definition from the repository. In addition, there are REST
services that allow controlling the CEP engine at run time. These
services allow starting and stopping a CEP engine, updating CEP engine
definitions and reading the state of the CEP engine (started/stopped and
its definition url).
