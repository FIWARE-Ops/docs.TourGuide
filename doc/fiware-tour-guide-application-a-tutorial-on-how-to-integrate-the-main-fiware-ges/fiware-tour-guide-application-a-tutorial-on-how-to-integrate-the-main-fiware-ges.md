 

**INTRODUCTION**

The FIWARE Tour Guide Application is a reference application aimed at
teaching and demonstrating how to combine different Generic Enablers
(GEs), in order to create a smart context-aware application. It exploits
the capabilities offered by Docker Containers provided by GEris.
Furthermore, the application allows an incremental instantiation and
linkage of different FIWARE GEs, as it is based on docker compose.

The main functionality offered is the smart management of a big
Restaurant franchise, including reservations, reviews and all the
parameters which have to do with managing each restaurant on a day by
day basis.   
 The implementation is being continuously updated and makes use of
Node.js and HTML5 technologies.

**APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY**

The list below summarizes some of the main functionalities currently
offered by the smart restaurant application:

-   Admit Customer reservations in accordance with current occupation
    and reservations made.
-   Register customer reviews according to different criteria (service,
    food, etc.).
-   Real-time control of different parameters at each restaurant
    location (occupation and temperature (at cuisine and at the dining
    room)).
-   Short time historic data of the different parameters monitored.
-   Publication of open data concerning the most relevant information
    about the different restaurant locations.
-   Web user interface to monitor information about restaurants.
-   Different user profiles (customer,restaurant manager, franchise
    manager) and functionalities per profile. 

**OVERALL ARCHITECTURE**

The figure below describes the architecture of the Smart Restaurant
application, which integrates a number of GEs:

**IoT GEs**: 

-   [Backend Device Management -
    IDAS](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas).
    It is in charge of connecting IoT devices (temperature & humidity)
    using the UL20 client. This component translates
    [UL20](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-figway/) client
    requests into NGSI context entities, enabling querying and
    subscribing to sensor data.

**Data GEs**:

-   [Orion Context
    Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker).
    It is responsible for managing all the application context
    information modelled as NGSI entities (Restaurant, Reservation,
    Review, …). 
-   [Cygnus](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus), part of the
    [Cosmos](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/bigdata-analysis-cosmos) ecosystem,
    is responsible for persisting historical context data in a target
    backend (MySQL or Hadoop) or as open data (CKAN). Cygnus is
    connected to Orion Context Broker through the
    subscription/notification interface.
-   [Complex Event Processing (CEP) - Proactive Technology
    Online](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/complex-event-processing-cep-proactive-technology-online)
    analyses event data in real-time, generates immediate insight and enables instant response to
    changing conditions like higher or lower temperature.


**Security GEs**:

-   [Authorization PDP -
    AuthZForce](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce),
    provides an API to get authorization decisions based on
    authorization policies, and authorization requests from a PEP proxy.
-   [PEP Proxy - Wilma](https://github.com/ging/fi-ware-pep-proxy), is a
    proxy that will respond to every application request. Working
    together with
    [AuthZForce](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce) and
    [KeyRock](https://github.com/ging/fi-ware-idm), it protects
    application resources based on the
    [AuthZForce](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce)
    PDP (policy decision point). As a result each user will only get
    access to the data she is authorized to, according to her profile. 
-   [IDM KeyRock](https://github.com/ging/fi-ware-idm), covers a number
    of aspects involving user profile management, oauth authentication,
    authorization & trust management, Single Sign-On (SSO) to service
    domains and Identity Federation towards applications. It interacts
    with
    [AuthZForce](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/authorization-pdp-authzforce),
    in order to define the policies that the [PEP
    Proxy](https://github.com/ging/fi-ware-pep-proxy) will use to
    protect the application resources.

Through a front-end application, managers get access to restaurants
under his duty and restaurant customers can make and browse reviews, or
even ask for reservations.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

To this aim we have connected, using
[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), six GEs deployed on
different containers. [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
enables the creation of a complete environment just by writing a .yml
(or .yaml) schema file. In that file several parameters are defined:
containers to be created, volumes to share data, how to link containers,
ports exposed and environment variables that will be used to configure
the Generic Enablers.

The docker-compose file created for the Developer’s Guide APP is
available
[here](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml) and
defines the scenario described by the image below. This configuration
has all the advantages of using isolated environments and exposing each
generic enabler from a desired port:

GUIDE\_2](images/IMAGEN-APP-TOUR-GUIDE_2-1024x650.jpg)](images/IMAGEN-APP-TOUR-GUIDE_2.jpg)

**EXPERIMENTING**

Download the
[repository](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App), make sure
you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and
running, then execute the following command:

    docker-compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml up

And everything will be up and running. 

Then, you need to add the container IP address to your hosts file to
make it reachable. In order to simplify this process, the
[get-docker-hosts](https://github.com/Bitergia/docker/tree/master/utils#get-docker-hosts)
script will do this job (sudo required), and it works both for Mac OS X and Linux platforms.

Once done, the user interface will be available at the host configured
in the docker-compose, which is ‘[tourguide](http://tourguide)’ by
default. So you just need to open it in your favourite browser:

http://tourguide

However, if you only want to play with an individual GE, for example,
Orion Context Broker, simply type:

    docker-compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.yml up orion

By following the same approach, you can also experiment with other GEris
provided in the application. You can query the Context Broker to dump
data, access Keyrock to manage users, roles and permissions, generate
sensors using the provided scripts, consume the Authzforce API to check
the policies or store/publish data in Hadoop or CKAN.

**QUERYING CONTEXT DATA**

For consuming the existing data in the Context Broker, there is a set of
queries that you can test by your own. Within that
[queries](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/master/utils/orion/devguide-orion-requests.json) you
will be able to (among others):

- Get a restaurant

    Query using NGSIv1:

    curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Fiware-Service: tourguide" -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://orion:1026/v1/contextEntities/Elizalde' | python -m json.tool

    Query using NGSIv2:

    curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" -H "fiware-service: tourguide" -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://compose_orion_1:1026/v2/entities/Elizalde' | python -m json.tool

- Filter by attribute and geo-location

    Query:

    curl -s -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "fiware-service: tourguide" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "entities": [
            {
                "type": "Restaurant",
                "isPattern": "true",
                "id": ".*"
            }
        ],
        "restriction": {
            "scopes": [
                {
                    "type": "FIWARE::Location",
                    "value": {
                        "circle": {
                            "centerLatitude": "43.185335",
                            "centerLongitude": "-2.471404",
                            "radius": "20000"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "FIWARE::StringQuery",
                    "value": "priceRange<20"
                }
            ]
        }
    }' 'http://orion:1026/v1/queryContext?details=on&limit=1'

- Generate subscriptions (in this particular case, for Cygnus)

    Query:

    curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "fiware-service: tourguide" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "entities": [
            {
                "type": "Restaurant",
                "isPattern": "true",
                "id": ".*"
            }
        ],
        "attributes": [ ],
        "reference": "http://cygnus:5050/notify",
        "duration": "P1M",
        "notifyConditions": [
            {
                "type": "ONCHANGE",
                "condValues": [
                    "aggregateRating"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }' 'http://orion:1026/v1/subscribeContext'

and more. Make sure you use the right host (by default
‘[orion](http://orion)’ in the Tour Guide Application).

**USERS, APPLICATIONS, ROLES AND PERMISSIONS**

There is an initial users, organizations, roles and permissions added by
default using the [python-keystone
client](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-keystoneclient/using-api-v3.html)
for Keyrock. The file is available in the
[repository](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/master/docker/images/tutorials.tourguide-app/keystone_provision.py) and
you can modify it according to your needs.

**SENSORS DATA**

Sensors by default are disabled as well as occupancy levels. To test it,
modify the docker-compose.yml file setting the variables:

    ORION_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED=true to generate the subscriptions
    SENSORS_GENERATION_ENABLED=true to generate them
    SENSORS_FORCED_UPDATE_ENABLED=true to update the values

And for the occupancy levels you can refer to a restaurant and/or time
frame. Check the options by doing:

    docker exec -i -t compose_tourguide_1 node
    tutorials.tourguide-app/server/feeders/occupancyupdater.js --help

It will update the occupancy levels from a restaurant at the time of
execution.

**DATA STORAGE: COSMOS (IoT) AND CKAN OPEN DATA**

Also you can store data into Cosmos Instance (Hadoop HDFS) or publish it
in CKAN.  
 For storing it in Cosmos you will need to modify the following file:

For Cosmos:

    cygnusagent.sinks.hdfs-sink.hdfs_username =
    cygnusagent.sinks.hdfs-sink.hdfs_password =

After the data is stored, you can perform data analysis using the [tools
provided](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/tree/master/utils/bigdata).

For CKAN [(demo.ckan.org)](http://demo.ckan.org):

    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink-XXXX.api_key=

And sensors data will be published under ‘tourguideidas’ organization.

**EVENTS PROCESSING**

Events generation is disabled by default. To start it, modify the docker-compose.yml file
setting the variables:

    ORION_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED=true to generate the subscriptions
    CEP_ENABLED=true to load the configuration

This will use the sensors generated by the ul20-client container, raising alerts when the
temperature raises above or drops below a certain threshold. Find detailed information of this
example [here](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/master/doc/CEP.md).

**XACML SECURITY POLICIES**

Finally, you can check the policies that Keyrock generates in
Authzforce. For that, we first retrieve the domain where the policies
are stored:

    docker exec -i -t compose_authzforce_1 curl -s --request GET http://localhost:8080/authzforce/domains | awk '/href/{print $NF}' | cut -d '"' -f2

And with the returned value, we retrieve the policy Set:

    docker exec -i -t compose_authzforce_1 curl -s --request GET http://localhost:8080/authzforce/domains/$DOMAIN/pap/policySet | xmllint --format -

That will returns the XACML PolicySet generated by Keyrock.

The XACML PolicySet should contain a set of policies that the PEP Proxy
will check to provide a decision (allow or deny) to a resource. Each
policy contain a Role, and the role itself will contain the allowed
permissions to each resource.

**CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS**

The FIWARE Tour Guide application, is a fast and generic way to have a
functional environment for experimenting with the main FIWARE GEs.  
 We plan to add more functionalities, refine the HTML5 user interface
and to deploy the application using the Docker infrastructure provided
by the [FIWARE Lab](http://lab.fiware.org). Last but not least In the
near future we will be integrating more GEs. Stay tuned by following our
Github [repository](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App)!
