Once obtained the initial set of components, you can start creating your
dashboard by adding some of the widgets into your workspace area:

<img src="../images/building_mashup/add_linear_graph.png" srcset="../images/building_mashup/add_linear_graph.png 2x" alt="Click *Add to workspace*"/>

<img src="../images/building_mashup/final_layout.png" srcset="../images/building_mashup/final_layout.png 2x" alt="Final layout"/>

You do not need to add those widgets in a particular order as you can
always move and resize them as you want. You can also minimize, remove,
rename, and configure, etc. those widgets.
