Once you are finished with your dashboard, you can either describe and
share it with other people by uploading it to the WireCloud catalogue,
or offer it in a store of the FIWARE Marketplace. You can even embed the
resulting dashboard in other web pages or sites outside WireCloud by
using the HTML code provided by the platform. For further information
regarding how to create an offering you can refer to the Store
documentation. The following figures illustrate how to obtain the HTML
code needed to embed your dashboard in external sites:
