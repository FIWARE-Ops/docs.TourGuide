Wirecloud is a web mashup platform aimed at empowering end users,
without programming skills, to easily create fully-fledged application
dashboards built up from widgets, operators and other pre-existing
mashups. These building blocks have been made available beforehand by
developers (and even other end users in the case of pre-built mashups)
in a shared catalogue.

Wirecloud offers two different perspectives of use depending on whether
you are a developer or an end user:

-   As a developer, Wirecloud allows you to use cutting-edge web
    technologies for easily developing mashable web components, namely
    widgets and operators, and connecting them to backend services (e.g.
    support for pub/sub, “connectors” to a number of FIWARE GEs, etc.)
    and data sources (e.g. data APIs). Once created, Wirecloud fosters
    their shareability and reuse by end users.
-   As an end user, Wirecloud allows you to develop application
    dashboards without the need of programming skills (e.g.
    infomediaries, domain experts, etc.). These dashboards are created
    visually by mashing up widgets and operators, i.e. integrating
    heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI web components to
    create value added “instant” applications.

The following screenshots pertain to an application dashboard created in
Wirecloud by a domain expert to manage and operate lamp posts and
reported issues (e.g. breakdowns, sabotages) in the context of a smart
city. The widgets and operators mashed up to produce the dashboard were
created and shared beforehand by developers and are connected to backend
resources by making the most of other FIWARE GEs such as the Orion
Context Broker and the Object Storage GEris thanks to specialized APIs
and libraries provided by Wirecloud.

Wirecloud also offers support for mobile devices, especially for
tablets, so that some of the widgets in an application mashup can be
enhanced to support native features of the device and/or transformed
into a native component to improve their performance when shown in a
mobile platform. As an example, the map in the app dashboard shown in
the following screenshot has been automatically replaced by a native
component with better performance and with access to the GPS features of
the tablet.
