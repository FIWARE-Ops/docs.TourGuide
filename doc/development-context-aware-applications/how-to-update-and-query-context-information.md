Processes running as part of your application architecture that update
context information using REST operations that the Context Broker GE
exports, are said to play a **Context Producer** role.  As an example,
let’s consider an application for rating restaurants (let’s call it
NiceEating). The client part of that application running on the
smartphone of users would play the role of Context Producer, enabling
them to review restaurants.

On the other hand, processes running as part of your application
architecture that query context information using REST operations that
the Context Broker GE exports are said to play a **Context Consumer**
role.  Continuing with our NiceEating app, the mobile application
running on the smartphone of users and enabling them to query for the
reviews of restaurants would play the role of Context Consumer.  Note
that a given part of your application may play both the Context Producer
and Context Consumer roles.  This would be the case of the mobile client
of the NiceEating app enabling end users to review and query about reviews
of restaurants.

Entities that would be relevant to the NiceEating application are of
type Restaurant, Client and Reviews. For example, when a given user
reviews a restaurant (e.g. in a scale from 0 to 5, “Client1234” rates
“4” for the “Elizalde” restaurant, which id is `0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f`, and describes his/her experience with "Cheap and nice place to eat.") the smartphone application plays the
Context Producer role **creating** a Review entity by issuing the
following HTTP request:

    POST <cb_host>:<cb_port>/v1/contextEntities/type/Review/id/review-Elizalde-34
    
    Headers:

    {
      'Content-Type':     'application/json',
      'Fiware-Service':   'tourguide'
    }

    Payload:

    {
      "attributes":
      [
        {
          "name": "author",
          "type": "Person",
          "value": "Client1234"
        },
        {
          "name": "dateCreated",
          "type": "DateTime",
          "value": "2016-04-20T18:19:33.00Z"
        },
        {
          "name": "itemReviewed",
          "type": "Restaurant",
          "value": "0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f"
        },
        {
          "name": "reviewBody",
          "type": "Text",
          "value": "Cheap and nice place to eat."
        },
        {
          "name": "reviewRating",
          "type": "Rating",
          "value": 4
        }
      ]
    }

Each time a new Review entity is created, the average rating for the
corresponding restaurant is recalculated by the application backend
which (playing also the role of Context Producer) **updates** the
Restaurant entity accordingly. For this example the user has reviewed the Elizalde restaurant:

    PUT <cb_host>:<cb_port>/v1/contextEntities/type/Restaurant/id/0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f/attributes/aggregateRating

    Headers:

    {
      'Content-Type':       'application/json',
      'Fiware-Service':     'tourguide'
      'Fiware-ServicePath': '/Franchise1'
    }

    Payload:

    {
      "value" :{
        "ratingValue" : 4,
        "reviewCount": 1
      }
    }

Note that the `Fiware-ServicePath: /Franchise1` header is needed for update operations because all restaurants are defined inside the scope of their department. For further information about this option visit <http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user/service_path/>.


Finally, the user can get the information of a given Restaurant using
the smartphone application. In that case the application works as
Context Consumer, **querying** the Restaurant entity. For example, to get
the aggregateRating attribute, the client application could query for
it in the following way (with extra headers `Fiware-Service: tourguide`):

    GET <cb_host>:<cb_port>/v1/contextEntities/type/Restaurant/id/0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f/attributes/aggregateRating    
    
    {
      "attributes" : [
        {
          "name" : "aggregateRating",
          "type" : "StructuredValue",
          "value" : {
            "reviewCount" : 1,
            "ratingValue" : 4
          }
        }
      ],
      "statusCode" : {
        "code" : "200",
        "reasonPhrase" : "OK"
      }
    }


You can also obtain the values of all attributes of the "Elizalde"
restaurant in a single shot (with extra headers `Fiware-Service: tourguide`):


    GET <cb_host>:<cb_port>/v1/contextEntities/type/Restaurant/id/0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f
    
    {
      "contextElement" : {
        "type" : "Restaurant",
        "isPattern" : "false",
        "id" : "0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f",
        "attributes" : [
          {
            "name" : "address",
            "type" : "PostalAddress",
            "value" : {
              "streetAddress" : "Cuesta de las Cabras Aldapa 2",
              "addressRegion" : "Araba",
              "addressLocality" : "Alegría-Dulantzi",
              "postalCode" : "01240"
            }
          },
          {
            "name" : "aggregateRating",
            "type" : "StructuredValue",
            "value" : {
              "reviewCount" : 1,
              "ratingValue" : 4
            }
          },
          {
            "name" : "capacity",
            "type" : "PropertyValue",
            "value" : 50
          },
          {
            "name" : "department",
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "Franchise1"
          },
          {
            "name" : "description",
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "Restaurante de estilo sidrería ubicado en Alegria-Dulantzi. Además ..."
          },
          {
            "name" : "location",
            "type" : "geo:point",
            "value" : "42.8404625, -2.5123277"
          },
          {
            "name" : "name",
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "Elizalde"
          },
          {
            "name" : "occupancyLevels",
            "type" : "PropertyValue",
            "value" : 0,
            "metadatas" : [
              {
                "name" : "timestamp",
                "type" : "DateTime",
                "value" : "2016-04-20T18:15:15.434Z"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name" : "priceRange",
            "type" : "Number",
            "value" : 0
          },
          {
            "name" : "telephone",
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "945 400 868"
          }
        ]
      },
      "statusCode" : {
        "code" : "200",
        "reasonPhrase" : "OK"
      }
    }



Alternatively, if you want to get the **attributes as a key map instead
of as a vector**, you can use the `attributesFormat` parameter, in the
following way (with extra headers `Fiware-Service: tourguide`):

    GET <cb_host>:<cb_port>/v1/contextEntities/type/Restaurant/id/0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f?attributesFormat=object    
    
    {
      "contextElement" : {
        "type" : "Restaurant",
        "isPattern" : "false",
        "id" : "0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f",
        "attributes" : {
          "address" : {
            "type" : "PostalAddress",
            "value" : {
              "streetAddress" : "Cuesta de las Cabras Aldapa 2",
              "addressRegion" : "Araba",
              "addressLocality" : "Alegría-Dulantzi",
              "postalCode" : "01240"
            }
          },
          "aggregateRating" : {
            "type" : "StructuredValue",
            "value" : {
              "reviewCount" : 1,
              "ratingValue" : 4
            }
          },
          "capacity" : {
            "type" : "PropertyValue",
            "value" : 50
          },
          "department" : {
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "Franchise1"
          },

          },

            "value" : "42.8404625, -2.5123277"
          },
          "name" : {
            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "Elizalde"
          },
          "occupancyLevels" : {
            "type" : "PropertyValue",
            "value" : 0,
            "metadatas" : [
              {

            "type" : "Text",
            "value" : "945 400 868"

      },
      "statusCode" : {

    }
