If you want your application to be “smart”, you have to first make it
“aware”. FIWARE provides you with means to produce, gather, publish and
consume context information at large scale and exploit it to transform
your application into a truly smart application.  

Context information is represented through values assigned to attributes
that characterize those entities relevant to your application. [The Context Broker GE (open source reference implementation: Orion)](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker)
is able to handle context information at large scale by implementing
standard REST APIs.

Context information may come from many different sources:

-   Already existing systems
-   Users, through mobile apps
-   Sensor networks

One of the most important features of the Context Broker GE is that it
allows to model and gain access to context information in a way that is
independent from the source of that information. As an example, your
application may need to be aware about “Places” (identified by their
specific geographical coordinates) and the “temperature” in them.  The
way in which the temperature of a given place is obtained may vary from
place to place.  Thus, the temperature of a given street may be measured
through temperature sensors deployed in that street, while in another
street it may be obtained through temperature sensors deployed on buses
that circulate through the street and even in some other streets may be
obtained through users who report the temperature using their
smartphones.  Using the RESTAPI exported by the Context Broker GE, the
way in which your application will be able to query the temperature of
places, or subscribe to changes on temperatures of places will be the
same no matter which is the source of a temperature and it will not vary
if the source of the temperature for a given place changes over time
(e.g., the temperature of a given street turns to be measured through
temperature sensors deployed on the streets rather than through buses
equipped with sensors).
