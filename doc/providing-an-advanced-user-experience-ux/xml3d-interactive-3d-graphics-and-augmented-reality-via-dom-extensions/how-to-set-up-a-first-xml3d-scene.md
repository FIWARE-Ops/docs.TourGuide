A set of example applications is deployed with your instance of XML3D
when you setup your instance of XML3D via the FI-Lab recipe. The same
set of example is also available online in the xml3d-examples github
repository:

http://xml3d.github.io/xml3d-examples/

Setting up a 3D scene with XML3D is simple. All you need is a web server
to which the website can be deployed. If you install the
3D-UI-XML3D-GEri directly from the recipe, an instance of an Apache2
server is already deployed.

To enable XML3D in your website, just add a link to the xml3d.js script
file to your website’s HTML.

A detailed tutorial of how to set up 3D scenes is given in the XML3D
eLearning courses and the 3D-UI-XML3D-GEi User and Programmer’s guide.
