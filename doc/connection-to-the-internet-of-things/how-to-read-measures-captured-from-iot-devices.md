The first thing you need to do is to connect your IoT devices or
Gateways to FIWARE. This basically means that your IoT devices’ observations reach a Context Broker.

During this tutorial, we provide an example on how you would
connect your devices using [Ultralight2.0](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-ul#protocol) (UL2.0) - which is a proposed
simplification of the SensorML (SML) standard - and get those devices
sending their measurements (observations) to the FIWARE Lab public
Context Broker. Ultralight2.0 is selected in this example because of its
simplicity. In addition we show you how you can do the same locally with the
*FIWARE Tour Guide Application* as it integrates the [IDAS UL2.0 IoT Agent](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-ul). 

If you want to quickly connect or simulate virtual devices you may also
check [https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-figway](FIGWAY),
a set of simple python scripts working as a client SDK for
any desktop PC, laptop or gateway supporting a Python 2.7 environment.
This way you may skip the steps described below and use the python
commands as described in the README.md file available at the Github
repository linked above.

For a more detailed description of the IDAS (FIWARE IoT Agent suite) APIs,
please have a look [here](http://docs.telefonicaiotiotagents.apiary.io/).

A typical IoT data workflow using FIWARE consists of the following steps:

Step 1 : **Create an IDAS Service**

  If you are using the public IDAS instance with the public `openiot`
testing service available at `130.206.80.47` (Port `5073`) you may skip this
step. Just keep in mind the shared secret for this public service (that
your devices need to know) is the string `4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov`.  
 Otherwise, creating an IDAS Service consists of a simple HTTP POST like this:

    POST http://130.206.80.40:5371/iot/services
    
    Headers:
    
    {
      'Content-Type':       'application/json',
      'X-Auth-Token' :      '[TOKEN]',
      'Fiware-Service':     'openiot',
      'Fiware-ServicePath': '/'
    }
    
    Payload:
    
    {
      "services": [
        {
          "apikey":      "4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov",
          "cbroker":     "http://0.0.0.0:1026",
          "entity_type": "thing",
          "resource":    "/iot/d"
        }
      ]
    }

  Where `0.0.0.0:1026` might be replaced by a private instance of
a Context Broker or just leave it as it is (`0.0.0.0:1026`) if the public
instance is running at the same VM (`130.206.80.40:1026`) will be used. The apikey
string should be updated with a shared secret to be known by your IoT devices. An OAuth
token is needed as well, a simple way of obtaining one
is described [here](http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/develop/quick_start_guide/index.html).

  Likewise, you may want to experiment using the *FIWARE Tour Guide Application*.
Assuming you have installed it locally, you can issue the following request: 

    POST http://localhost:4041/iot/services/
    
    Headers:
        
    {
      'Content-Type':       'application/json',
      'Fiware-Service':     'tourguide',
      'Fiware-ServicePath': '/'
    }
        
    Payload:
        
    {
      "services": [
        {
          "apikey":   "tourguide-devices",
          "cbroker":  "http://orion:1026",
          "resource": "/iot/dev-restaurants"
        }
      ]
    }


Step 2: **Register your IoT device**

  Before your device sends observations or receives commands a register operation is needed:

    POST http://130.206.80.40:5371/iot/devices
    
    Headers:
    
    {
      'Content-Type':       'application/json',
      'X-Auth-Token' :      '[TOKEN]',
      'Fiware-Service' :    'openiot',
      'Fiware-ServicePath': '/'
    }
    
    Payload:
    
    {
      "devices": [
        {
          "device_id":   "[DEV_ID]",
          "entity_name": "[ENTITY_ID]",
          "entity_type": "thing",
          "timezone":    "Europe/Madrid",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "object_id": "t",
              "name":      "temperature",
              "type":      "number"
            }
          ],
          "static_attributes": [
            {
              "name":  "attr_name",
              "type":  "string",
              "value": "value"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

  The important parameters to be provided are:

  * `entity_type` the entity type to be used at the Context Broker. In the example above, `thing`.
  * `entity_name` the entity ID to be used at the Context Broker. In the example above, `thing:[ENTITY\_ID]`.
  * `attributes`  they should include an alias (a letter representing this attribute).
  * `static_attributes` only if your device needs to define static attributes (sent in every observation).
 
  Likewise, using the *Tour Guide Application*, you can create a device bound to a restaurant entity.
  Such device will provide ambient measurements, for instance `temperature`, for a specific restaurant.
 
    POST http://localhost:4041/iot/devices/
     
    Headers:
    
    {
      'Content-Type':       'application/json',
      'Fiware-Service':     'tourguide',
      'Fiware-ServicePath': '/'
    }
    
    Payload:
    
    {
      "devices": [
        {
          "device_id": "restaurant-sensor-0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f",
          "protocol": "UL20",
          "entity_name": "0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f",
          "entity_type": "Restaurant",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "object_id": "t",
              "name":      "temperature",
              "type":      "number"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

Step 3: **Send Observations related to your IoT device**

  Sending an observation from an IoT device is extremely efficient and simple with the following HTTP request:

    POST  http://130.206.80.40:5371/iot/d?k=[APIKEY]&i=[DEV_ID]
    
    Headers:
    
    {
      'Content-Type':  'text/plain',
      'X-Auth-Token' : '[TOKEN]'
    }
    
    Payload:
    
    't|25'

  The previous example sends a new temperature measurement which
is automatically propagated to the corresponding entity at the
Context Broker and FIWARE Service defined previously in our IDAS service.
`[API_KEY]` must be the one used when creating the service and `[DEV_ID]`must be the device
identifier formerly registered. 

  Similarly, you can do the same with the *Tour Guide Application*:

    POST http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=tourguide-devices&i=restaurant-sensor-0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f
    
    Headers:
    
    {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
    }
    
    Payload:
    
    't|22.3'

  Sending multiple observations in the same message is also possible with the following payload:

    "alias1|value1#alias2|value2#alias3|value3..."
    
    't|23#h|80#l|95#m|Quiet'

Step 4: **Reading measurements sent by your IoT device**

  Finally, after connecting your IoT devices you (or any other
developer with the right access permissions) should be able to use the
Context Broker NGSI API to query the NGSI entity assigned to your device. 

  In the first example, using the public FIWARE instance,
you may check in the public Context Broker (at `130.206.80.40:1026`), the
Entity\_ID=”thing:[ENTITY\_ID]” and the attribute `temperature` with the correct updated value.

  In the *Tour Guide Application* example you can check that the temperature value has been properly
propagated by running (with extra headers `fiware-service: tourguide`):

    GET http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f?attrs=temperature
    
    {
      "id": "0115206c51f60b48b77e4c937835795c33bb953f",
      "type": "Restaurant",
      "temperature": {
        "type": "number",
        "value": "22.3",
        "metadata": {}
      }
    }
