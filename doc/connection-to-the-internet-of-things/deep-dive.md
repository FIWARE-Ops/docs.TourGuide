Should you wish to learn much more about this, please check the following IoT Agents:

- [IoT Agent Ultralight2.0](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-UL): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between the UltraLight2.0 protocol and NGSI. FIWARE Lab public instance details are [here](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas/instances). 
- [IoT LWM2M](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-LWM2M): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between the Lightweight M2M protocol and an Orion Context Broker and NGSI
- [IoT Agent JSON](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-JSON): This agent is designed to be a bridge between the MQTT+JSON protocol 
and NGSI.
- [IoT Agent Node Lib](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-node-lib): library to create new agents. This core library allows to develop new protocols for specific southbound protocols/standards/messages.

There are existing [IoT Agents instances up and running](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas/instances) available. These would be useful for testing purpose and learning about how to interact between IoT Agents and Orion Context Broker. 
Orion Context Broker implements the FIWARE NGSI standard. 

Other alternative implementations would be used instead
