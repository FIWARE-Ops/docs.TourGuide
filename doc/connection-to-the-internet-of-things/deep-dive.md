Should you wish to learn much more about this, please check the following IoT Agents:

[IoT Agent Ultralight2.0](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-UL): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between an UltraLight2.0 protocol and an Orion Context Broker . FIWARE Lab public instance details are here. 
[IoT LWM2M](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-LWM2M): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between an Lightweight M2M protocol and an Orion Context Broker.. 
[IoT Agent JSON](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-JSON): This agent is designed to be a bridge between an MQTT+JSON based protocol and an Orion Context Broker.
[IoT Agent Node Lib](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-node-lib): library to create new agents. This core library allows to develop new agents for specific southbound protocols/standards/messages.

There are, already, [IoT Agents instances up and running](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas/instances).These would be useful for testing purpose and learning about how to interact between IoT Agents and Orion Contextbroker. 
Orion ContextBroker implements the FIWARE NGSI standard. 

Other alternative implementations would be used instead
