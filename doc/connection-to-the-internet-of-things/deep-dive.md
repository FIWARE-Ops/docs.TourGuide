## GitHub Repositories

- [IoT Agent Ultralight2.0](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-UL): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between the UltraLight2.0 protocol and NGSI. FIWARE Lab public instance details are [here](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas/instances).
- [IoT LWM2M](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-LWM2M): This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between the Lightweight M2M protocol and NGSI.
- [IoT Agent JSON](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-JSON): This agent is designed to be a bridge between the MQTT+JSON protocol and NGSI.
- [IoT Agent Node Lib](https://github.com/Fiware/iot.IoTagent-node-lib): library to create new agents. This core library allows to develop new protocols for specific southbound protocols.

There are existing [IoT Agents instances up and running](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas/instances) available. These would be useful for testing purposes and for learning about how to interact between IoT Agents and Orion Context Broker.
