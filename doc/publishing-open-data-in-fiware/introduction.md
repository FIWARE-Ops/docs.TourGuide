This section explains how users (both end users and developers) can
publish data in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE, as well as how they
can publish offerings containing this data in the FIWARE Store (Biz 
Ecosystem GE) so as to set access control policies over it and/or 
monetize it. You should note that at the time of writing this document,
FIWARE offers two different types of data: context information and 
datasets. Each type of data should be published in a different way 
and for this reason youâ€™ll find two differentiated sections. A third 
section is devoted to explain the benefits of publishing your data 
in the FIWARE Store and the way of doing it.
