Publishing and consuming open data is a cornerstone for the development
of applications and the creation of an innovation ecosystem. In this regard,
this section explains how users (both end users and developers) can
expose their data publishing it in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE,
as well as how they can create offerings containing this data in the FIWARE Store (Biz
Ecosystem GE) so as to set access control policies and/or monetize it.

You should note that at the time of writing this document, FIWARE offers
two different types of data: context information (as seen in in the section
[Development of context-aware applications](/development-context-aware-applications/introduction/))
and datasets. Each type of data is published in a different way
and for this reason youâ€™ll find two differentiated sections. A third 
section is devoted to explain the benefits of publishing your data 
in the FIWARE Store and the way of doing it.
